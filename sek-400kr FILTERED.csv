Costers del Segre - 4.2. A smooth wholesome wine with a nose of black cherry, cassis, vanilla oak. Nice weight & very good finish, palette became more pronounced over time. Great find from a new region. I've been very lucky with Spanish wines recently & I find if you pay a little more, you get a lot back 😀

It’s black, dry and packed full of flavour. The price is what it is but you get what you pay for. It’s everything you would want from a wine. I look at it this way. I go for a meal and I pay between £25-£30 for a bottle of wine which you can buy for £10 on the high street.

Interesting restaurant in a strip mall in midtown miami. Loved the place with 15 seats, hidden place with amazing tapas concept. Whatever we ate was crazy!!

The wine was decent yet not a value wine. You would probably drink this in europe for 40-50eur in a restaurant whereas almost the double in the us. 

Mediocre wine soft and easygoing.  cherry with  leather silky finish. 

Drank two bottles but not highly recommended. Not really complex and sophistication. ",2019-11-30T04:45:56.000Z,Montesecondo,Tïn 2019,4.0,53,

I’m pleasantly surprised. This doesn’t taste 6 years old- it has attained an early maturity with wise tannins and a piercing red florality. Marzipan, mocha. Paired wonderfully with the original shrimp and grits.

Dark red colour. Spices, dark cherry, smoky, earthy and faint chocolate notes in the nose, hardly any fruit. I detect violets at the rim of the glass. This medium to full-bodied beauty has dry fruit, spices and an earthy touch. Pleasant acidity, tannins present, as to be expected at this age. Ends with a lingering, spicy and dry finish. A nicely balanced and multifaceted wine. Definitely has potential for at least 10 years. Will pair well with red meats and game.

This was consumed next to a higher rated and more expensive Chilean wine on the night and was further proof, as if needed, that my tastes lean towards more classical styles. 2012s are variable across Bordeaux. However thus far it seems southern Left bank wines, odds on, are in a good drinking spot now. This classic red from an established chateau is drinking very well. Complex and balanced without being spectacular it is self assured, complex and moorish.

On the palate is elegant, beautiful tannins, not overpowering, and ripe black fruits with a hint of tobacco, vanilla rounds it up to a beautiful full body wine, but well balanced to drink as is, or perfect also to pair with food, red meats, or chicken with spices.

Tannins are resolving but still quite evident. Quite a dash of ripe Cabernet in this blend although Garnacha is the main grape. 
It feels like a cross between a Bordeaux and a Super Tuscan. Very much of its time, 2005, when the mantra of bigger is better. 15.5% alc. completes the picture. However the wine is still balanced and has a curious freshness from great acidity

As apparently this is something I seek, this wine hits high marks!

Taste is smooth with a velvety mouth feel. But, it finishes I a way that leaves you chewing. And thinking! 
Fun indeed.

La Garde produces Cabernet Sauvignon that develops stronger tannins on this plot in Pessac-Leognan, and hence, they will use punch down extraction techniques instead of pump over, which is more about extracting aromatics & flavors instead of tannins.

Primitivo di Manduria Riserva
DOC 2012

Primitivo has always been my personal favourite. I finished this bottle of wine over the course of two days and it’s just splendid to see the development of this wine. On the first day (one hour decanted), this wine reminds me of dark chocolate with cherry fillings. Dark chocolate, earthy, cedar, vanilla, plum and cooked cherry balanced w/ medium(+) acidity. On the second day, the prune flavour became more dominant. What a wonderful delight!

A bottle from the Tignanello degli Antinori Estate, always at excellent quality and undisputed protagonist all over the world. Since the 2011 vintage, this wine is made exclusively 100% from grapes of the gorgeous Tenuta Tignanello in San Casciano Val di Pesa (home to its namesake wine Tignanello, and Solaia) and sees mostly Sangiovese blended with a smaller part Cabernet Sauvignon and other complementary grapes. This reduced the production volume and set in motion a further leap in quality. ⤵️

The Marchese Antinori has led the charge in the resurgence of Italy as a wine world power! And he puts his name on this particular Chianti for a reason.

This is a very stylish Chianti, presenting itself in a brilliant ruby red robe. The nose ranks itself in a medium range of soothing red fruits & a hint of vanilla, old world style. But more depth in the palate with primary notes of blackberry & rich raspberry. The finish? 26 generations of experience here.

It’s made almost entirely with Sangiovese with a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon. Dark, dense, tongue-staining ruby red with wonderfully aromatic nose of cedar, leather, tobacco, spice and dark red fruits with an underlying menthol note. Dry, medium+ acidity with medium+ body, 14% abv and fine firm tannins.

It has a nose with huge impact, wide deep rich red fruit, vanilla, earthy mature complexity. Voluptuous perfection.

Palate has tannin first, then acid and then fruit, slightly out of order. If it had the balance of the nose it would be five stars but it doesn't, some food should balance it. Does lack the depth promised on the nose but still deserves the Antinori label!

At 7 years it is spot on (for me).
Med body, med acidity, med tannins - perfectly balanced.
Red fruit with the obvious cherry and also raspberries.
Earthy with great minerals, smoke, oak, and spices such as pepper and clove.
Some balsamic,  leather and tobacco adds to the complexity.
Italy 🇮🇹 and Tuscany at its best 🤩",2022-03-12T19:23:21.000Z,Antinori,Tenuta Tignanello 'Marchese Antinori' Chianti Classico Riserva 2019,4.2,1004,
2019,1654,4.5,"Just cracked it and had the first sip. Will document my tasting throughout. 

Brick in colour. Cherries, leather and cigar box on the nose. Very Brunello like. 

Finish last for days. I would say low acidity and medium + tannin. Given the low acidity, not sure how much life this has.

Just finished the bottle. WOW!  The tannin got stronger as the wine opened up. Finished with a high tannin. Was chewing on this wine for minutes after each sip. 

4.4⭐️. Very good wine! Excited to have 5 more bottles 😉🍷",2022-02-12T19:56:29.000Z,Antinori,Tenuta Tignanello 'Marchese Antinori' Chianti Classico Riserva 2019,4.2,1004,

2019,1654,4.0,"Tour and tasting at Marchesi Antinori Estate in Bargino, Italy 

90% Sangiovese from Tignanello w/ 10% Cab blended together and aged in Hungarian Oak.

Aroma of maraschino cherries and mushrooms. Flavors of dark cherries, candied cherries, white pepper, leather, tobacco, cedar and licorice.  Mouth coating tannins, acidity is bright, and a supple finish. 

Aging the two varietals together in oak barrels seems to  provide a more integrated, elegant, and almost silky palate.

The bouquet needs a little air to open and showcase red forrest berries, gummy bears, hint of oak and cloves. 

The palate is round and filling with fruit depth, lively acidity and friendly tannins to keep it on track for improvement. Today, its a pretty cool +7.5/10 but will reach higher levels in 5 years.

I really wanted to love this wine, but it's just a bit too bitter and dry for my taste. On the nose, there is a dark cherry, licorice and fennel smell. Also a wood-like component.

If you like smooth, soft and mellow acidity and tannins, well this wine is perfect for you. I like more ""aggressive"" juice. It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy it, opposite of that.
Very elegant wine both with smell and taste.
Sweet smell of black currant and blackberry, herbs ( lovely), tangerine and a lot of other ""things"".

This is tasty Tuscan red blend I enjoyed with Osso buco at the restaurant.
🍇: 35% Syrah, 35% PV, 30% CS.
Aging: 14 months in French oak tonneaux, followed by 10 months in bottle.

👃: Intense and medium complex aromas with bouquets of wild berries, plum, dried spices, oak and hint of tobacco are on the nose.

👄: Full body and concentrated. Well-balanced seductive black fruit flavor, soft tannins and the note of spices are well-harmonized with moderate complexity and linger on the palate medium long.",2019-02-22T09:08:05.000Z,Rocca di Montemassi,Maremma Toscana 2017,4.3,41,

We’ve found here a delightful second wine of a Grand Cru Classé, that has nearly anything that you’d from a Grand Bordeaux left-bank wine: complexity, maturity, elegance, and depth combined with the richness of ripe fruit from a favorable vintage.
Of course, it doesn’t have the absolute tannic structure’s density, and won’t have the ageability of a Grand Vin, but this makes it all the more approachable and enjoyable to drink now.

I think it has some plum or blackberry flavours but the acidity just overwhelmed them. Maybe this is too young or maybe it’s just not good.

45% CS, 30% Merlot, 20% CF and 5% PV; aged for 18 months in French oak.

Well balanced, the oak is very decent and well integrated.
The tannins are still a bit drying and rough. A good acidity gives this red a good aging potential.

This minor '14 Bourgogne rouge from Vougeraie has aged well and is ready for consumation!
👁 Brick red with a grey rim.
👃 Canned cherries, sourish earth notes with delicious organic decay, hazelnuts and a whiff of mushrooms.
👅 Light bodied; tiny & diluted fruit, refreshing acid, but overall a superficial texture that needs depth & persistence.

Of course it’s young, but it’s lacking fruit already so this one won’t improve that much in the coming years. If you love Pinot Noir either double the amount and get a Cru, or better still, pay anywhere between 15-30 euro’s and get a New-Zealand Pinot Noir, which will blow you away.

Medium bodied with ripe fruits and fresh acidity.  Sour cherries dominates the palate, but with a slight kick of wet earth and barnyard funk.  Tannins are really soft and this is a wine that can and should be enjoyed young.

Slightly expensive for what it is, and I would rather spend my money elsewhere.",2017-03-11T20:13:12.000Z,Domaine de la Vougeraie,Pinot Noir Terres de Famille 2019,3.9,170,
