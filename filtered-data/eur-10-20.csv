2017,2798178,3.0,"ORIGINAL ZINFANDEL

Not a lot of people know that Zinfandel and Primitivo are basically the same grape. Primitivo was indigenous to Apulia but only increased in popularity and quality when the grape became famous stateside during the 19th century.

It was both earthy and smoky on the nose, while the palate showed more fruits such as blackberry, sweet spice and liquorice. It tasted sweet and heavy on the palate with smooth tannins. But because of the sweetness, I don't think I can drink a lot of this.",2017-03-14T06:20:27.000Z,Masca del Tacco,Li Filitti Riserva Primitivo di Manduria 2017,4.3,996,14.8,en

2019,3252940,3.0,"An organic undisclosed blend from Valencia.
Concentrated aromas of stewed dark berries, with Blueberry standing out. Deep, unctuous aromas but alcohol or light VA unbalances it.

A powerful 14.5% with deep, rich flavours and medium tannins.
High acidity, full bodied. 
Great length with lighter fruit and liquorice appearing from the mid palate. 

MLF is apparent after a bit of air. 

Could benefit from from a few more years ageing to integrate and mellow.",2017-10-25T16:09:25.000Z,Neleman,Just Fucking Good Wine Organic Tinto 2019,3.8,167,10.5,en

I will post the review of this wine if she decides to serve it. In the meantime, it's a delight to have low key, non wine snob friends who deeply appreciate any gift of wine you bring.

Smell: ripe plum and blackberry smell, very fruity expression. Almost like an alcoholic dark fruit distillate. Also aromatic with thyme, cinnamon and cloves. Smoky character. 

Taste: overwhelmingly alcoholic, followed by what is Shiraz to me (plum and pepper), very bitter finish of fresh black olives. Fine grained tannin on the gum. 

Shiraz is not me. This one is no exception, especially because it’s an extraordinarily aggressive specimen.

The wine on nose is not very noteworthy but again maybe too many years passed to open it. 

On palate it doesn't disappoint but it doesn't really throw me off the cliff either. It's good, but not $80 good. 

Don't me wrong it is a good wine but for its price range ($60-$80) I'd go with a Protos of the same aging (Reserva) any day, any time.

A very spicy and earthy entrance to the palate, with wax, mushroom, white pepper notes. Long red plum finish.  This is a rather earthy tipped Pinot, best to have with meat dishes

2020,1169531,4.0,"Third of these I have had. First time I  reviewed it I said ""Bright cherry on the palate initially that turned to a precise, long, savoury finish. Excellent light bodied mouthfeel with refreshing well balanced acidity. The grapes come from 60 to 80 year old vines that are farmed biodynamically and the wine is made without sulphur"". Little to add to that other than either the wine is getting better or I am simply enjoying it more. The depth of the flavour on the finish was lovely. Excellent Beaujolais.

It’s a soft, smooth and spicy wine, with blackberry, blueberry & plum balanced well with rustic, earthy mushroom flavours.

Dark rubyred towards purple in colour. Fruity aroma with sweet dark fruit, plum, prune, cherry and spices. 

Based on Tempranillo with some help from Syrah and Garnacha. The wine has first spent 8 mths on French oak barriques, then a further 3 mths on steel (40%) and other oak (60%) before bottling.

My first wine from this volcanic Portuguese Island. This special soil is very important for the wine as well. 
A blend from a large number of different grapes. 

Quite surprised on the wine, a real beauty, lighter red in colour. Lovely nose with fruits, spices and fine wood. On the palate red berries, cherry, strawberry blackberry, added with nice spices, minerality, a touch of wood, fine tannins and a smooth finish. Like this wine and I concur with the vivino average.

13.5% ABV with 2 g/L sugar.
Aromas of oak, vanilla and blackberry on the nose. The palate adds to the nose, plum, tobacco and slight smokiness.

This wine tastes infinitely better with food. The nose is more interesting than the taste which seems to be bit of a common theme with me & French wines atm.

Full bodied. High acid & tannins. Sour cherry BlackBerry Cedar Redcurrant. Dry with a reasonably short finish. I expected more.
Bringing out the beef bought it to life a little but this is a bit bitter & overpriced for my liking.

Leave to breath for 4 hours.

Black in color, stem not visible. Meniscus is violet.
Aroma typical for Priorat with thin aroma of blueberries and light sweetness.
Taste is nervous, 1 second like you expect from Priorat wine then unbalanced acidity and bitterness kill it, then elegant silkyness with blueberry sweetness break-off, replaced by nasty acidic-bitterness which also breaks in few seconds and wine becomes tasteless like water. On next sip this repeats.
Finish is low intense, slighly velvet with acidity",2017-02-20T18:50:15.000Z,Alfredo Arribas,Gotes del Priorat 2020,3.9,81,19.02,en
