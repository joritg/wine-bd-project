2016,1984446,4.0,"Happy Bordeaux Sunday (N. M√©doc edition). 3+ hour decant rich aromas of black fruit dark cherry vanilla tobacco and graphite. Very earthy smoky palate at first with little fruit. After more airtime, blackberry blackcurrant cassis oak chocolate and some spice. Full bodied and on the dry side with firm grippy tannins and lots of acidity. Long dry earthy finish. Incredible pairing with braised short ribs prepared by @[1|10538791|Adele Rubin-Herzenberg].

We opened with their second wine, which is a wonderful effort, especially at the price point vs the top wine.

Second label from the prestigious Cos D'Estournel located in Saint Estephe near Lafite & Mouton. The soil is nearly all pebbles - I've held it - even tasted it! It's true. The 09 is approachable because 09 was a goldmine in Bordeaux - intense aromatics of perfumed raspberry, but will take time to expose the soil! Why do we drink French wine!?!

One of my first 2011 in Bordeaux. I will need to try a few more to really picture the vintage. This St Estephe is a little overpowered by alcohol on the nose, with a hint of mint at the back end.

The aromatics aren‚Äôt fully developed, the feel and texture are a little austere, and the wine dissolved rather than finishes at this stage.

On the nose aromas of green bell peppers, black currant leafs, blackberries and toasted coffee beans.
The palate has fresh acidity, firm and astringent tannins, lack in concentration and length. There is an intense bitterness that I can't identify the source.
Overall I was expecting too much of this wine. Excellent producer and excellent vintage, but in my opinion it doesn't deliver the quality I hoped for. There are much better options in the same price range.

The flavors of strawberry and cherry were very distinguishable, but there was a softness and roundness to it that I wasn‚Äôt expected. I was looking for something that was going to attack my taste buds and have more of a ‚ÄúPOW‚Äù factor, but it never happened. It stood  up well to a fabulous steak dinner.

Decanted for 2+ hours. At first pour, I picked up unripe  cherries, raspberries and violets with prominent alcohol. 

After 30 minutes, it decided to call it a night and shut down completely. 

This has significant upside because it's from a top Barolo producer and from a great vintage which at present is dormant. Give this at least another 6+ years.

This started a bit lay back, although did not decant but airing in glass over 2 hrs gives a much integration of its black fruits , mainly blueberry , plum & touch of tobacco & dried sandalwood. 

Palate is easy drinking, blueberry & plum , later some herbaceous. Gd lifted structure and medium body with gd finished .

Deep ruby red.

Blackcurrant, bacon, gravel in nose.

In mouth, when chilled, coating tannins are so soft and silky. Long fruity finish. 

When warms up, tannins get a bit rougher, as well as acidity becomes a bit higher than you'd want it to be. So it feels like this wine needs a few more years to fully integrate tannins and come into full balance.

Pleasurable wine with a gentle, feminine character.
