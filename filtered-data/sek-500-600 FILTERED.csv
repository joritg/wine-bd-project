Very fragrant and expressive on the nose, lavender, eucalyptus, blueberries, smoke and green olive saline nose.

2015,2084836,3.5,"Not often I taste Sancerre Rouge so it was interesting for me to try this Belle Dame, Vacheron’s top cuvee from 50 yr old vines. Pinot Noir was more prominent in the Loire pre-phylloxera but was overtaken by Sauvignon Blanc since then, and hasn’t quite gained the fame of Cab Franc to be Loire’s top red varietal.

Crunchy raspberry fruit with astringent, drying tannins and searing acidity. A bit imbalanced and disjointed to me though some aeration would’ve helped. Hope my next glass will be better. ",2018-08-08T10:10:49.000Z,Domaine Vacheron,Sancerre Belle Dame 2015,4.2,148,525.408118878548,en

Dry fryity finish. Long retention. Nice balance.
Somewhat European style but very ripe and a little heavy.

2015,1142892,3.5,"2017 vintage.  Dark ruby/purple color, forest fruit and kerosene on the nose.  Dark fruit, Asian spice, licorice, graphite on the palate.  I'm perplexed by the rave reviews.  My bottle is astringent and unbalanced with sharp tannins and low acidity.  Perhaps it was not stored well, but for the price, this is a huge disappointment.  I can think of dozens of better Rhone wines for half the price.  89 points.

Strong intensity. Black fruits, black currant. Fresh, slightly dried. Herbs and spices. Mineral. Toasty.

Perhaps too young for some,  I find the fresh black fruit (blackberry; blueberry) combines well with spice oak  (tobacco) notes. M all round, maybe m+ and I’d personally prefer some more acid to balance the taste as without this it feels a bit flat. Maybe it will get more tertiary complexity to balance out fruit forward primary in later years. Dusty tannins round out a pleasant mouthfeel.

Huge volume & powerful aroma intensity showing tobacco, blackberry, raspberry, cherry, bell pepper, leather, black pepper, licorice & mushroom.

The pure & assertive tobacco when opened will never be forgettable. As it got more airtime, there have been many changes in characters and it became more delicate & complex, while the secondary aroma was more dominant from the opening to the end.

It was full of beautiful & gorgeous aroma and complexity on the nose.

2017,1500451,3.5,"Drinking this long-lived Cabernet Franc makes me wonder if we are drinking our Loire reds too early.

I was surprised how delicate and elegant a Cabernet Franc can be. Clos de la Dioterie is a 2.1ha plot with 85+ year old vines.

Tasted blind - Sweet shades of tobacco, light with subtle complexity. It tasted like a light version of Bordeaux without loosing any charm or complexity.

It is a lot lighter than the dark and concentrated Californian Cabernet Franc. Spiced plums and stewed berries. Lovely.

WMK's. Closed initially, saline minerality+, later fragrant flowers, sweet red cherry strawberry. Mouthfeel light medium, with good balanced sl sweet tannins, red berry driven than vanilla oak. Good length, delicious aftertaste, quiet oozing intensity rather than fullfrontal palate. Refined elegance closer in style to Marroneto than the Siro Pacentis.

2014,1194277,4.0,This is a big bold rich Brunello - darker black fruit than expected with some red cherry mushroom tobacco wet leaves etc. A smooth dry wine with great acidity and spicy finish - quite intense. Aged in barriques (30% new) for twelve months and then in larger Slavonian casks for three years. A very nice Montalcino but for the money I prefer the lighter cherry styled Brunello’s than this style albeit I won’t complain if some one is pouring me this again :-) 🍷,2021-02-05T01:23:07.000Z,Tenuta San Giorgio,Ugolforte Brunello di Montalcino 2014,4.0,375,551.4640725290556,en

Complex nose of wild strawberry, black currant, oak, leather seats in a new car, mint, dried herbs, cinnamon, violet, and tobacco.

Flavors of sour cherry, blackberry, plum, vanilla, licorice root, cocoa powder, and tar.

Medium+ fine tannins, medium ++ lively acidity, and good balance, even in its youth.  The nose is more impressive than the taste but both are great.  This is a complex and quality Brunello.

It was a medium ruby in the glass. The nose showed cherry, tobacco, leather, cedar, smoke, vanilla, thyme, and cocoa. Very intense aromas!

In the mouth, this wine had a medium silky smooth body, with medium plus tannin and medium plus acidity; moderate alcohol at 13.5%, and a long dry finish. 

Enjoyable, but needs time. Cheers!

Foreboding & actually aggressive notes of graphite alongside the newest of new leather and a prune jus infused with reduced violet petals. I thought it was a bit porty but maybe 15% Bolgheri Merlot is supposed to be?

It is not. I tasted it & summoned the (Italian) somm, he took my glass away, poured one of his own, compared them, then came back with a new one. 

Note to Enoteca users - keep it clean.

Expected more at this price point and Antinori. At Pull n Pour it was hardly a 3*, but we also knew it needed some aeration. Aeration helped!

2017,1752790,4.5,"What a pleasant surprise. You’d never say by the label that this book is actually a romantic drama. 
The first chapter made me curious, the second grabbed my attention...and the third made me fall into a deep cathartic state of adoration. 
Vague ambiguity on the nose, lustful delight on the taste buds and utter sexual daze down the trachea. 
When you go to the book store buy 50 Shades Of Grey. It’s not THAT bad, it’s actually legendary. 
Like this Wine. With a capital “W” for Win.

2017,86560,4.5,"Open and perfumed, with aromas of sandal wood, sour cherries, plum, toasted wood, black olives, smoked meat, medicinal & stems.
The palate has sharp acidity, great concentration and tannins that are ripe, firm but fine grained. Medium bodied, and extremely complex with a long length.
This wine is ageing perfectly well and I believe this is at the peak. It should keep for another 3-5 years and start declining. A great example of tannin extraction with enough fruit to support the long ageing.

Dry, full bodied, with dusty tannins, slightly edgy acidity, and a moderate to long finish.
