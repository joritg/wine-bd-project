2012,4793,4.5,"Interesting wine - on one end it is extremely well made and an outstanding wine. The thing that bothers us is that the flavors are a bit vanilla to us. 

Iconic Nero d'Avola from Sicily.

Full of black cherry, plum, Med herb, sweet cedar, with a touch of perfume and pepper. Fine grained tannins and an intense, long finish. Lots of polish and some international flair from the touch of Syrah and Petit Verdot

This is oustanding wine technically, but it tastes like it could have been constructed anywhere

Deep ruby Color
Distinctive on the nose, from the moment it pours in to glass. Cherry jam, oak, plum, vanilla, prune, followed by flower bouquet, perfume, then it flow to menthol, mint, pepper, bay leaf, and hint of earthy & forest floor notes 
Super balanced & concentrated on the palate,mineral, savoury on the beginning but turns into fruity while it opens up. Dusty tannin, holds it well 
Def worth a high 4 rating👏👏👏

2012,4793,3.5,"I found out that I had forgotten a 2011 bottle of this Mille e Una Notte. Well... I can say it is still good, although I wouldn't reckon it as a long term wine. A lot of fruit, a lot of wood, Even a sweet finish. Overall very pleasant after all these years",2020-01-08T21:21:47.000Z,Donnafugata,Mille E Una Notte 2012,4.3,1543,41.83,en
2012,4793,4.0,"tasted in 2021. Despite decanting it remained quite closed for a long time and only opened up properly the next day. Dark dry fruits on the nose. Plum notes. Full bodied and heavy style. Relatively smooth on the finish and pleasant aftertaste. Taste notes of dark fruits as well. BlackBerry and plum. Nero d'avola comes across. Not a bad wine and no obvious fault, but it didnt really stand out. Taste lacked complexity overall and silkiness that would have expected from this price range",2021-03-11T13:18:33.000Z,Donnafugata,Mille E Una Notte 2012,4.3,1543,41.83,en
2012,4793,4.0,"For CNY, was really excited to share this with family, easier to drink wine that can pair with all of our dishes well. Super plump dark fruit notes followed by oak, leather, chocolate, cinnamon, tobacco too. Shows some aging of mushroom umami, but still very young. Just what I’m looking for in a festive wine with a bit of sweetness. Elegant tannins. Not sure if this vintage represents the wine, so much value for the price. Makes me even more curious about Nero d’Avola.",2021-02-11T13:55:47.000Z,Donnafugata,Mille E Una Notte 2012,4.3,1543,41.83,en

Castellero is opposite Cannubi. Fruit and spice here, fleshy and mineral. Cherry, plum, raspberry, liquorice, lily. Acidity quite dominant at this young age.

Nebbiolo night, April 2017

Quite famous Barolo producer.
1983 is the oldest vintage of Brezza that I have ever tried and can confirm that they age beautifully.

Very intense perfumed aromas with nice depth and volume. Unusual tertiary aromas of cough syrup with underlying herbs. Flavours are on a candied side. 

Wine though feels very fresh and definitely in good shape and is fully matured. It won't get any better, but will stay for a few years more at this beautiful state.",2018-04-03T10:15:50.000Z,Brezza,Barolo Castellero 2015,4.0,94,39.89,en

2008,1161268,4.5,"Mystere 2000 Claret 5 of 9

Powerful nose of cedar branch, cigar box and cassis 

So neatly knitted together. Big hit of blackberry, pencil sharpening.

Precise and classic. It's been said many times but Sociando is the greatest non-classed Left Bank.

If tonight gets better than this I'll be a very happy man!

2008,1161268,4.5,"Zoom Tasting with the Van Crew, Wine #2 - my contribution to last night’s Cabernet Sauvignon blind tasting. Again, this understated Soc-Mallet from 2000 punched above its Haut-Medoc weight class. A proper, mature claret: herbaceous aroma-flavours surround its preserved black fruits with damp earth, truffles, mushrooms, coffee beans, old leather. Mature, sweet tannins, impressive acidity, lovely texture. My last bottle was enjoyed by all and among the stars of the night, voted as 2nd WOTN!

2008,1161268,3.5,"Guessed this to be a modern producer from Pessac or Graves which spoke volumes about the vintage - apparently Sociando handled 2003 better than 2005. I guessed that this was not a classified growth as the tannins were a little more rustic than the Duhart-Milon that came before. Lots of blackcurrant fruit, alcohol was showing a little too much, especially compared to the more classic 2001 that I had last week.

Very young appearance with pencil shavings, dark berry fruit (blackberry, blueberry, black currants), violets, cedar wood and some earthy tones. Matured and well knitted wine with again dominance of black fruits in the taste together with coffee flavours. Tannins start to kick in after a few seconds.

👃🏼 Concentrated spicy nose of cedar, leather, forest floor, tobacco, graphite, pencil shavings, espresso, eucalyptus, cinnamon, bay leaf, rosemary, cigar box, clove, baking spices, black pepper, licorice and raisin.  

👅 Still fresh on the palate with notes of red currant, sour cherry and blackberry. Rounded yet powerful tannins are well integrated and backed by medium acidity. 

✍🏼 Pretty good in shape for a 28-years old but just not very exciting.

Overall: well matured bordeaux, performing better if not as well as many 1855 classified.

Tardieu Laurent  is solid Negociant of South France.I've tried most of wines from them, they all outgoing and good.I normally consume their CnDP and Rasteau for table.And I think it's very suitable for casual gathering of wine lovers.

Actually, this Cornas is V.V. Blending 60 years and 100 years grapes from Le Chaillot,Patou and les eygats.

Absolutely fantastic value for money. It went well with japs BBQ.  Ripe black fruit, smoke, cedar on the nose; concentrate; full bodied. Notable tannin yet within the comfortable range. Acidity slightly stood out at first but balanced out after a while.

Black fruit & cherry, just a bit of nutmeg, lots of wet leather on the palate. Long and somewhat spicy finish. A great choice for a formal dinner built around wagyu roast beef.

So far most appellations I have reported were disappointing, as Bordeaux 2013 wines lacked structure, complexity and tannins. Can only serve the wines for early drinking as there's no aging capability.

21 years old Pauillac!
First of all and very important: you will have to beat/swirl this wine back to life!
At first the nose is moldy and moisty. But be patient. It slowly (very slowly) opens up with some mature dark fruit like plum and cherries and warm spice. Same with the palate which has the same notes and also has a good acidity and a long spicy finish.

Silky texture and low acidity, medium in body on the palate displaying sweet tobacco, black fruits and violet hinting of smoky accent.
Finish is long with residual violet.

Pauillac produced top quality wine for 1982, despite the fact that this was a fifth classified growth, quality was still above expectations. 

Typical smoky nose blend with menthol / eucalyptus plants. Palette was with totally integrated tannins, pleasant and chunky, or rather beefy style. The wine had a lot of weight, I felt that it was heavier in terms of true weight compared to other wines. Lacked some definitive character and a bit flat was the weakness.

This Pauillac made of 62 % Cabernet Sauvignon, 28 % Merlot, 6 % Petit Verdot and 4 % Cabernet franc, has barrel ageing for 12 months in new barrels for 50-55%.

If we're talking QPR, we've had zins we've enjoyed at the same level for less cash-money. But considering it's hard to find here (it sells out quick), it was an enjoyable treat! 😘🍷👌",2019-02-15T04:04:36.000Z,Caymus,Zinfandel 2019,4.5,283,44.55,en

This smelt like wet dog big time! Mind you there was no decant time with this, so that could be why.  It went away and had more of a jammy scent...grape jam.

Big fruity flavours, a hint of oak, and big tannins.  Mouth feel was heavy and the finish was long.  I think this still needs time to develop those complex flavours and with the current structure I feel like it can handle a other 5 years.",2016-12-03T17:46:49.000Z,Caymus,Zinfandel 2019,4.5,283,44.55,en

Dark, dark ruby in color.

It was lovely and juicy a little sweetness but nicely balanced with the subtle tannins and a distinct smokey finish.

Fresh dark ripe fruit, soft tannins, and some oak. Very subtle wine, doesn't make much out of itself. Because of that it lacks some structure to hit the big stars.

2012,79272,5.0,"Our family’s Christmas wine for 2021. An elegant and balanced Margaux. The 2010 vintage has thrown up stunners that have been a pleasure to partake. Has all the character of what makes Margaux simply irresistible. Perfectly approachable today, but I suspect more bottle years will allow it to further excel. Notes of black fruit, cassis, raspberry, vanilla, toast, tobacco, cigar box, petroleum, mushroom, forest floor, violet and hints of plum. Lingering finish with a balanced and linear sip to swallow.",2020-12-31T17:44:08.000Z,Château Marquis de Terme,Margaux (Grand Cru Classé) 2012,4.1,641,41.88,en
2012,79272,4.0,"Summary: great wine; already drinkable but will improve even more I reckon. Great succulent and sweet tones of ripe fruit, wood, laurel and herbs. 

On the nose: hints of black fruits, laurel, rosemary, leather, tobacco, oak, ripe cherry, blackcurrant and ripe violet. 

On the palate: wonderfully elegant, sweet and succulent. Warm and embracing with layered complexity. Very nice finish.

After an hour of breathing, meat decayed and other aromas appeared - plum, cassis, cedar, dark chocolate, vanilla, spices, like anise and cloves. Palate is acidity driven with powerful, but softened tannins, plum, blueberry, cherry, chocolate, cedar and spices, long aftertaste. Wine evolved from 3.7⭐ to 4.2⭐, so I recommend to decant it.",2019-11-16T21:21:48.000Z,Château Marquis de Terme,Margaux (Grand Cru Classé) 2012,4.1,641,41.88,en

Aroma is out of this world, Smokey with a floral smell at the end. This bomb taste started with a solid strong oak accompanied by a bitter cheese flavor, or maybe tobacco sensation, and finish with sweet vanilla touch maybe fresh forest fruits.

2016,1221380,5.0,"Back in the game. Gathered my wine crew for a St Emilion journey at my place. 

I have been saving this one since 2 years and I felt timing was right although could have wait until 2022. Needed to continue the St Emilions though. Merlot game strong. Bold one. Full body. Medium acidity. Oak and plum blackberry notes. 

Definitely recommended, Pricing is correct. need to stock up more on this.

What about the difference between Gigondas and CdP. Well not that much but the terroirs of CdP are really well suited for wines close to the Rhone and well oriented, that is probably why wine is made there for ages now. Also gigondas benefits from the same but closer to some mountains (dentelles). 

This wine is really to be kept to fully benefit the potential, 2016 promising as vintage. Ripe black fruits, garrigue, spices, violet, tapenade. Very elegant wine and top finish.

Just amazing juice all around. ",2022-04-18T20:02:24.000Z,Belle Glos,Eulenloch Pinot Noir 2018,4.4,209,46.41,en

A deep ruby red colour wine, packed up with fruits like cherries and cranberries.

anyway, good balance and complexity, light but pleasant body.

👁 Deep Garnet

👅 Medium(+) bodied palate revealing flavors of cherry, plum, raspberry, bell and pepper. Tannins are still slightly greenish but seem to be well developed over time. Medium acidity and earthy finish with medium(+) length are promoting the complexity.

Great wine with a nice structure with a brown-red color. However, I believe that the wine has reached its best drinking maturity with 5.

🌬 INTENSITY:
Pronounced nose, which literally jump out. Medium+ on the palate.

🎛 COMPLEXITY: 
Complex structure: cooked strawberries, blackberries, cherries and currants. Tobacco, smoke, caramel, oak, leather, dark chocolate aromas.

⚖️ BALANCE:
Velvety tannins which are perfectly integrated. Too much acidity, but could already be due to age.

A mediocre Amarone. Amarone is not really my type favorite vine.

👃🏻🤧Dark cherries and raisin and hints of chocolate.
